  abstract = {Researchers in ecology and evolutionary biology are increasingly dependent on computational code to conduct research. Hence, the use of efficient methods to share, reproduce, and collaborate on code as well as document research is fundamental. GitHub is an online, cloud-based service that can help researchers track, organize, discuss, share, and collaborate on software and other materials related to research production, including data, code for analyses, and protocols. Despite these benefits, the use of GitHub in ecology and evolution is not widespread. To help researchers in ecology and evolution adopt useful features from GitHub to improve their research workflows, we review 12 practical ways to use the platform. We outline features ranging from low to high technical difficulty, including storing code, managing projects, coding collaboratively, conducting peer review, writing a manuscript, and using automated and continuous integration to streamline analyses. Given that members of a research team may have different technical skills and responsibilities, we describe how the optimal use of GitHub features may vary among members of a research collaboration. As more ecologists and evolutionary biologists establish their workflows using GitHub, the field can continue to push the boundaries of collaborative, transparent, and open research.},

  abstract = {Clonal growth of plants is attained by a number of morphologically different organs (e.g. stolons, rhizomes, and roots), which are not functionally equivalent. Consequently, these clonal growth organ (CGO) types can determine functional traits that are associated with clonality, although little is known about their evolutionary flexibility or the constraining role they play on clonal traits. We investigated the rates of evolutionary change by which individual CGOs are acquired and lost using a set of 2652 species of Central European flora. Furthermore, we asked how these individual CGOs constrain functionally relevant clonal traits, such as lateral spread, number of offspring, and persistence of connections. We show that plants can easily switch in evolution among individual types of CGO and between clonal and nonclonal habits. However, not all these transitions are equally probable. Namely, stem-based clonal growth and root-based clonal growth constitute evolutionarily separate forms of clonal growth. Clonal traits are strongly constrained by individual CGO types. Specifically, fast lateral spread is attained by stolons or hypogeogenous rhizomes, and persistent connections are attained by all rhizome types. However, the ease with which clonal organs appear and disappear in evolution implies that plants can overcome these constraints by adjusting their morphologies.},

  abstract = {Accurate field data are essential to understanding ecological systems and forecasting their responses to global change. Yet, data collection errors are common, and data analysis often lags far enough behind its collection that many errors can no longer be corrected, nor can anomalous observations be revisited. Needed is a system in which data quality assurance and control (QA/QC), along with the production of basic data summaries, can be automated immediately following data collection. Here, we implement and test a system to satisfy these needs. For two annual tree mortality censuses and a dendrometer band survey at two forest research sites, we used GitHub Actions continuous integration (CI) to automate data QA/QC and run routine data wrangling scripts to produce cleaned datasets ready for analysis. This system automation had numerous benefits, including (1) the production of near real-time information on data collection status and errors requiring correction, resulting in final datasets free of detectable errors, (2) an apparent learning effect among field technicians, wherein original error rates in field data collection declined significantly following implementation of the system, and (3) an assurance of computational reproducibility—that is, robustness of the system to changes in code, data and software. By implementing CI, researchers can ensure that datasets are free of any errors for which a test can be coded. The result is dramatically improved data quality, increased skill among field technicians, and reduced need for expert oversight. Furthermore, we view CI implementation as a first step towards a data collection and analysis pipeline that is also more responsive to rapidly changing ecological dynamics, making it better suited to study ecological systems in the current era of rapid environmental change.},

  abstract = {Understanding the distribution of herbivore damage among leaves and individual plants is a central goal of plant–herbivore biology. Commonly observed unequal patterns of herbivore damage have conventionally been attributed to the heterogeneity in plant quality or herbivore behaviour or distribution. Meanwhile, the potential role of stochastic processes in structuring plant–herbivore interactions has been overlooked. Here, we show that based on simple first principle expectations from metabolic theory, random sampling of different sizes of herbivores from a regional pool is sufficient to explain patterns of variation in herbivore damage. This is despite making the neutral assumption that herbivory is caused by randomly feeding herbivores on identical and passive plants. We then compared its predictions against 765 datasets of herbivory on 496 species across 116° of latitude from the Herbivory Variability Network. Using only one free parameter, the estimated attack rate, our neutral model approximates the observed frequency distribution of herbivore damage among plants and especially among leaves very well. Our results suggest that neutral stochastic processes play a large and underappreciated role in natural variation in herbivory and may explain the low predictability of herbivory patterns. We argue that such prominence warrants its consideration as a powerful force in plant–herbivore interactions.},

  abstract = {Several species concepts (SC) have been suggested as ways to view species, most of them based on Mayr's Biological SC. Recent research has raised the debate on the application of the species concepts to Oncocyclus irises. All the Oncocyclus species are able to produce vital progenies when crossed, thus, according to the Biological SC, they are a single biological species. Quantitative morphological characters are continuous among populations and also correlate with environmental conditions, preventing species delimitation according to Phenetic and Ecological SC. Genetic studies revealed high genetic diversity within the populations, thus, obscure delimitation by Phylogenetic SC. Pollination of the Oncocyclus irises is not species-specific, yet no transitional forms exist on the rare occasions of sympatric/parapatric distribution, roughly supporting delimitation according to the Recognition SC. The conclusion is that Oncocyclus populations do not clearly fit into species boundaries according to the relevant species concepts. Oncocyclus irises are distributed along an Ecogeographical Speciation Cline that could lead to one of three patterns of divergence, that is, discrete, ecotonal, or continuous, along the spatial dimension. Nonetheless, the exact variation pattern is not clear because of the patchy distribution. The taxonomic status of the Oncocyclus irises is viewed in light of the evolutionary processes in this highly variable group.},

  abstract = {Interactions between plants and herbivores are central in most ecosystems, but their strength is highly variable. The amount of variability within a system is thought to influence most aspects of plant-herbivore biology, from ecological stability to plant defense evolution. Our understanding of what influences variability, however, is limited by sparse data. We collected standardized surveys of herbivory for 503 plant species at 790 sites across 116° of latitude. With these data, we show that within-population variability in herbivory increases with latitude, decreases with plant size, and is phylogenetically structured. Differences in the magnitude of variability are thus central to how plant-herbivore biology varies across macroscale gradients. We argue that increased focus on interaction variability will advance understanding of patterns of life on Earth.            ,               Editor’s summary              Herbivory is a major selection pressure on plants, which have evolved many different physical and chemical adaptations to prevent animals from eating their tissues. However, herbivory pressure can be highly variable, even between plants in the same population. The Herbivory Variability Network consortium used standardized surveys to compare herbivory variability within populations at 790 sites across five continents. They found that the weak increase in mean herbivory at lower latitudes was accompanied by lower variation between individuals. Smaller plant species had higher herbivory variability, which also showed a phylogenetic signal. These findings highlight how variation in species interactions can influence eco-evolutionary outcomes. —Bianca Lopez            ,               Smaller plants at lower latitudes show higher variation in herbivory pressure among individuals.},

  abstract = {Many flowering plants exhibit dual reproductive modes, producing both sexual and asexual offspring. The commonest form of asexual reproduction is clonal growth, in which vegetative modules (ramets) are produced by the parental genotype (genet). In plants, sexual and asexual reproduction usually occur simultaneously, and this can lead to allocation trade-offs and antagonism between reproductive modes. Our review considers the ecological and evolutionary consequences of functional interactions between clonal reproduction and pollination and mating. Clonal reproduction is commonly associated with mass flowering, restricted pollen dispersal, and geitonogamous self-pollination, processes that can result in inbreeding depression and pollen discounting. We review evidence for the correlated evolution of clonality and sexual systems, particularly self-incompatibility, and identify several floral mechanisms that function to reduce mating costs by limiting selfing and pollen discounting. We conclude by discussing the loss of sexuality in clonal plants and consider the genetic and environmental basis of sexual dysfunction.},
